In a small village, there was a tiny house called a nipa hut.
It was made of bamboo and palm leaves.

Inside lived a happy family.
Around the hut, there were vegetable gardens.
They grew tomatoes, eggplants, radishes, and beans.

Every morning, the children helped water the plants.
They sang and played under the warm sun.

The family shared their food with neighbors.
Everyone loved the cozy nipa hut.
