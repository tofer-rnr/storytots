Once upon a time, in a small village, there were two lovers.
Their names were Juana and Aging. They loved each other very much.
But Juana’s parents did not like their love. Still, Juana did not care. She kept meeting Aging in secret.

One day, Juana’s father caught them.
He became very angry and chased Aging with a big knife. He hit Aging’s arm, and it was cut off.
Aging ran away, and Juana was left crying. She picked up Aging’s arm and buried it in their backyard.

The next day, something strange happened.
Juana’s father was surprised to see a new plant growing where the arm was buried.
The plant was green, with long, wide leaves. It grew a yellow fruit that looked like a hand with fingers.

Juana saw the plant and remembered Aging’s arm. She softly said his name:
“This tree is Aging.”

From then on, people called the plant “Aging.”
As time passed, the name changed into saging — the banana tree.
