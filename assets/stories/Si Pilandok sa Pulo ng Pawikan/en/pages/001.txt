One sunny day, Pilandok, a clever little animal, rode a small boat across the bright blue sea.

Soon, he reached a place called Turtle Island.
Big, gentle sea turtles walked slowly on the sand.

“Hello, friends!” Pilandok said.
But the turtles looked sad.

“What’s wrong?” he asked.

A big turtle said,
“Fish nets are stuck on our beach. We cannot reach the water.”

Pilandok smiled and said, “Don’t worry. I can help!”

He pulled the nets, pushed the wood, and cleared the path.
The turtles slowly walked to the sea.

“Thank you, Pilandok!” the turtles cheered.

Pilandok waved and said,
“Helping friends makes the heart happy!”

Then he sailed away, smiling under the warm Philippine sun.
