From the north, a group of hunters came to Liwayway’s place. Sadly, one of them, named Tanggol, was hurt by a wild pig. The young man was brought to Liwayway’s father to be treated. This was how Liwayway and Tanggol first got close.

Liwayway and Tanggol fell in love even in a short time.

When Tanggol got well, he said goodbye to Liwayway and her parents. He told them he would return with his own parents to ask for Liwayway’s hand in marriage.

Liwayway was full of dreams as she watched Tanggol leave.

But her hope was lost when Tanggol did not come back as he promised. Many moons passed since he left, but no news came to her.

An old suitor became jealous and spread lies. He told people that Tanggol would not return because he already had a wife.

Sadness, longing, anger, and jealousy filled Liwayway’s heart. She became sick. Since no one could heal her pain, after some weeks she grew weaker and died.

Before she died, her last words were:
“I curse you! Curse you…”

Those were the only words Liwayway left for Tanggol.

A few days after she was buried, Tanggol came with his parents. He explained that he was delayed because his mother was sick. He could not believe that Liwayway, the woman he loved most, was gone.

Every day, Tanggol cried at Liwayway’s grave. He never went back to his hometown, choosing instead to stay and watch over her resting place.

One day, he saw a small plant growing on Liwayway’s grave, watered by his tears. When it bloomed, it gave off a sweet smell. People called it “Sumpa Kita,” the last words Liwayway had spoken. Later, this became known as “Sampaguita.”
