A long time ago, there was no rice in the land.
People ate fruits and roots, but they were always hungry.

In one quiet village lived a kind girl named Mayi.
One day, a shining golden bird flew down and gave her tiny yellow seeds.

“Plant these seeds,” the bird said. “They will feed your people.”

Mayi planted the seeds on the soil.
Soon, tall green plants grew.
On top of each plant were golden grains.

The people were happy.
“This is wonderful! What do we call it?” they asked.

Mayi smiled and said,
“We shall call it rice.”

From that day on, the people had food to eat,
and they never went hungry again.
