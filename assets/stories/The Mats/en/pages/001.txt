In a small village, Lina helped her family make mats from dried grass.
She wove the grass carefully, thread by thread.

One day, her little brother Tino spilled water on a mat.
“Oh no!” said Lina.
“The mat is wet!”

Mama smiled and said,
“It is okay. We can dry it in the sun.”

Lina laughed and helped Tino.
Together, they dried the mat and fixed it.

From that day, Lina learned that helping and sharing makes work easy.
