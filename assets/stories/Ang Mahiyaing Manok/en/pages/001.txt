In a small farm, there was a shy little chicken named Coco.
Coco liked to hide behind the hay and never wanted to play with the other chickens.

One sunny morning, the farmer called,
“Come, Coco! It’s time to eat and play!”

Coco peeked from behind the hay.
“I am too shy,” he whispered.

A kind hen walked over.
“Don’t worry, Coco. We can be friends.”

Slowly, Coco came out and joined the other chickens.
He pecked the corn and ran around the farm.

Coco realized,
“It’s fun to play with friends!”

From that day on, Coco was never shy again.
