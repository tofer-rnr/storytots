Miko had twelve shoes.
Each shoe was different: red, blue, green, and yellow.

One day, Miko wanted to wear them all.
He tried one on, then another, until his feet were full of shoes!

His little sister laughed.
“Miko, you look funny!”

Miko giggled and said,
“Yes! Shoes can be fun!”

He took them off and arranged them neatly.
“I will play with my shoes later,” Miko said happily.
