long, long time ago, before cars and tall buildings, the Philippines was a land of green forests and clear blue seas.

In one small village lived a boy named Alo.
He loved to listen to stories from the elders.

One night, Alo sat beside the fire.
“Lolo, what was our land like long ago?” he asked.

Lolo smiled and said,
“Long ago, our people lived simply.
They fished in clean rivers, planted rice, and helped one another.”

Alo imagined brave fishermen on boats,
and families working together under the warm sun.

“Remember, Alo,” Lolo said,
“Our history is full of courage and kindness.
We must keep these in our hearts.”

Alo nodded with a big smile.
He felt proud to be Filipino.
