n a small forest, there was a tiny bird named Putot.
Putot was small but very curious.

Every morning, Putot sang a happy song.
He looked for seeds and bugs to eat.

One day, a strong wind blew.
Putot felt scared and hid under a big leaf.

A friendly butterfly came by.
“Don’t be afraid, Putot. You are brave,” said the butterfly.

Putot took a deep breath and flew again.
He found new friends and shared his seeds.

Putot learned,
“Even small birds can be brave.”
