Lia was a happy little girl who loved hats.
One day, she found a bright red hat in her grandma’s old box.

When she put it on, something magic happened.
The hat began to shine!

Lia said, “Wow! This hat is amazing!”

When she wished for a flower, a flower popped out.
When she wished for a butterfly, a butterfly flew around her.

But the magic hat only worked when she was kind.

One day, a sad boy had no snack.
Lia wished for food and shared it with him.

The hat glowed brighter than ever.

Grandma said, “A good heart makes magic real.”

Lia hugged her hat and smiled.
She learned that kindness is the greatest magic of all
