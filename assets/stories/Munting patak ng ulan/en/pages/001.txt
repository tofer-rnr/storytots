High up in the clouds lived a little raindrop named Pip.
Pip was small, shiny, and very curious.

One day, the clouds grew dark.
The wind whispered, “It’s time to go down.”

Pip felt excited.
He jumped from the cloud and fell gently to the earth.

He landed on a leaf.
“Hello, Leaf!” Pip said.

Then he slid down to a flower.
“Hello, Flower!” he giggled.

Pip joined other raindrops and flowed into a small stream.
Together they made the plants happy and green.

Pip smiled and said,
“I love helping the world grow.”

And soon, the little raindrop was back in the clouds,
ready for another adventure.
