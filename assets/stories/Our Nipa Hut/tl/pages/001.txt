In a small Philippine village, there was a nipa hut standing under the tall coconut trees.
The hut was simple, but it was full of love and laughter.

Inside lived a little girl named Lila and her Lola Rosa.

Every morning, Lila helped her Lola sweep the floor made of bamboo.
The hut would shine in the sunlight, and the wind would whisper through the walls.

One day, a strong wind blew.
“Lola, will our house be okay?” Lila asked.

Lola smiled and said,
“Our nipa hut is small, but it is strong. It bends with the wind. It keeps us safe.”

The wind passed, and the hut stood tall.
Lila hugged her Lola and said, “I love our home.”

Lola replied,
“A home is not big or fancy.
A home is a place filled with care, family, and happy hearts.”

And from that day on, Lila felt proud of their little nipa hut—
a warm, cozy home in the heart of the Philippines.
