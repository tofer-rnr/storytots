In a small village lived two children, Lina and Tomo.
They were half-siblings, which means they had the same father but different mothers.

Sometimes, Lina and Tomo argued.
“Hey! That is mine!” they shouted.
“Don’t take my toy!”

One day, a big rain came.
They ran to the small hut to stay dry.

Inside, they shared one blanket and laughed.
They realized, “Even if we are half-siblings, we can care for each other.”

From that day, Lina and Tomo tried to be kind.
They learned that family is important.
