Lito was a young boy who did not like chores.
One day, Mama asked him to help sand a wooden chair using sandpaper.

Lito touched the sandpaper.
“Ouch! This is rough!” he said.

Mama smiled and said,
“Yes, it is rough. But it helps make the wood smooth and nice.”

Lito slowly rubbed the sandpaper on the chair.
His hands got tired, but the chair became shiny.

“Mama, I did it!” Lito said happily.

Mama hugged him.
“Sometimes, hard work feels rough… like sandpaper,” she said.
“But in the end, it makes us better.”

Lito smiled proudly.
He learned that effort makes good things happen.
