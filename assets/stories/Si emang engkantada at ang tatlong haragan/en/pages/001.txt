In a quiet village lived Emang the Fairy.
She loved to keep the forest clean and safe.

One day, three naughty boys came.
Their names were Toto, Pito, and Kiko.

They threw trash on the ground.
They kicked plants.
They scared the birds.

Emang appeared in a flash of light.
“Why are you hurting the forest?” she asked.

The boys laughed and said, “We don’t care!”

Emang waved her magic wand—spark!
The boys suddenly turned into trees.

“Stay here and learn,” Emang said.

After a while, the boys felt sad.
They missed running and playing.

“We’re sorry!” they cried.

Emang smiled.
Poof! She turned them back into boys.

“Respect nature,” she said.
The boys nodded and never harmed the forest again.
