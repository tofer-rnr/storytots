Luna woke up early.
Today, she would go to the market with her Mama.

When they arrived, the market was full of colors and sounds.
Vendors called, “Fresh fish! Sweet mango!”
Luna held her Mama’s hand tightly.

They bought red tomatoes, green veggies, and sweet bananas.
Luna smiled when a kind seller gave her a tiny flower for free.

Mama said, “Be polite, Luna. Say thank you.”

“Thank you!” Luna said happily.

After buying food, they ate warm rice cakes.
Luna looked around and said,
“The market is noisy but fun!”

Mama laughed.
“Yes, Luna. The market is full of life.”

Luna went home smiling, excited to come back again.
