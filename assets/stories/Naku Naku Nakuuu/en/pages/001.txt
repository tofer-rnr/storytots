One sunny morning, Toto and his sister Mimi were playing outside.
Toto ran too fast and tripped over a small rock.
“Oh no! Oh no!” shouted Toto.

Mimi helped him up.
“Are you okay?” she asked.

Toto nodded and smiled.
“I’m fine. Thank you, Mimi!”

They laughed and continued to play.
From that day, Toto learned to be careful while running.
